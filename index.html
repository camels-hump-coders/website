                <p class="team-intro"><span class="hello-word">Hello!</span> We're the Camels Hump Coders, a group of middle school students from Huntington, Vermont. We all love to build, create and invent. We have a team that competes in FLL, First Lego League, which is an international program for kids to develop their skills in building, engineering and coding as well as other STEM topics. This program has a huge science component along with building a lego robot and coding various missions.
One of our teammates had experience with the league and wanted to form his own team. He asked his group of friends if they were interested and they agreed. We officially formed the team in 2023 and since then we have made some amazing accomplishments.
